# Projects

## Open Source work

In no particular order:

* [mini-vm](https://github.com/philipaconrad/mini-vm) :: A register-based bytecode interpreter in about 300 lines of C code. Uses a jump table instead of the usual switch/case architecture found in most bytecode interpreters.
* [SOOMpy](https://bitbucket.org/sdii/soompy) :: A port of a civil engineering toolkit from MATLAB to modern Python. I started and maintained the early versions of the project, wrote most of the early documentation, and then set the engineers loose on the domain-specific parts. The original lab now maintains this project entirely.
* [omaha](https://github.com/philipaconrad/omaha) :: My senior year Capstone projectâ€”hacking on voting machines. We got most of the way to an information disclosure attack on the PEB cartridges used to store votes.
* [ompt-50-rs](https://github.com/philipaconrad/ompt-50-rs) :: Bindings for the first-party OpenMP Tool interface, allowing Rust applications to hook into OpenMP 5.0 runtime events, and change runtime parameters. Used in one of my USC graduate research projects.
* [slackstatus.sh](https://github.com/philipaconrad/slackstatus.sh) :: A short command-line tool to update your Slack status, using the [Slack Presence and Status API](https://api.slack.com/docs/presence-and-status). Made in an afternoon because a colleague put up a bounty for the tool to exist.
* [matrix-archiver-sqlite](https://github.com/philipaconrad/matrix-archiver-sqlite) :: A script to archive content from several [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) chats I care about. Supports incremental backups.

## Closed Source work

In no particular order:

* _QRECT_ :: A web-based test-taking platform developed by [RCI group](http://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/division_of_information_technology/rci/). During a summer there I worked on the original database backend and got the testing infrastructure started for the project.
* _Camp Hill Sensor Firmware_ :: The "Camp Hill v2" was a prototype sensor platform in use at [SDII Lab](http://sdii.ce.sc.edu/) for various research projects. By the time I arrived at the lab, the sensor platform had been commercially abandoned. Over the course of a summer, I reverse-engineered the dual-board system, re-wrote a chunk of the firmware code (fixing a longstanding connectivity bug), and isolated a cause of data corruption to manufacturing defects.
* _Presence Tech_ :: A multi-year contract project with a local startup ([ASSET, LLC.](http://asset-us.com/)) to turn the vibrations from footsteps into position information (think the Marauder's Map from Harry Potter). The project is now exploring industrial and medical applications of the tech. The original codebase was entirely offline, and constructed from a patchwork quilt of applications and programming languages. I developed the current system, which makes analysis results from analog sensors available to application developers in near-realtime. I have also written the entirety of the developer-facing API documentation for the later iterations of the system.
