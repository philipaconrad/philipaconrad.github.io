# About

I live in South Carolina, the muggiest state in the union. The roads suck, and life is not possible in the summer without air conditioning. The food is pretty tasty though, and the people are great.

I'm currently doing a PhD in [CS](https://cse.sc.edu/) at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/). I have the opportunity to learn things and do research, so that's pretty cool.

In my free time, I like [throwing people](http://www.scaikido.org/), [building things](projects.html), and reading books, not necessarily in that order.
