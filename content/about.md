# About

I currently work as a Software Engineer for a cloud authorization company called [Styra][styra]. They're known for building and open-sourcing the [Open Policy Agent][opa-docs] project. It's a great place to work, with an awesome team.

Before Styra, I was working on a PhD in [CS](https://cse.sc.edu/) at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/), which after I ultimately chose not to finish. I walked out with a Masters degree and a deep appreciation for the complexities of hardware design. I also met some amazing people along the way, who have had immeasurable impact on my career.

Most of my free time these days is spent with family, friends, and my three adorable cats. (Pictures coming soon!)

Thanks for dropping by my blog!
